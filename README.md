DBMS Project

Made by students of IIIT Delhi , as a part of our course CSE202 Database Management Systems (DBMS) under the guidance of Prof Mukesh Mohania


Includes managing the database of sport facilities and equipments, handling the users(players) and vendors. The application helps the user join sport events (which are hosted on the application), connect with other players, borrow-lend the equipments from their peers or the authorities or place buy/repair orders for the same. Includes the vendors also as a stakeholder wherein they can register themselves and manage their orders given to them by the users. The manging authorities can also use this application to manage the venues and their equipments.
